        ##### What is Design of Experiments (DoE)?
        
        Design of Experiments is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. It helps in identifying the optimal conditions for a process, understanding which variables are most influential, and how they interact.
        
        ##### How to Choose the Right Design:
        
        1. **Consider your goals**: Are you screening for important factors, optimizing a process, or exploring relationships?
        2. **Factor count matters**: More factors often require more efficient designs
        3. **Factor types**: Some designs work only with continuous factors
        4. **Expected relationships**: If you anticipate non-linear effects or interactions, certain designs are better suited
        5. **Resource constraints**: Consider how many experimental runs you can afford
        
        Use the filters above to find the most appropriate design for your specific needs.

It is particularly effective for uniformly sampling high-dimensional spaces, making it ideal for applications in numerical integration and optimization. The sequence is designed to fill the parameter space more evenly than pseudo-random sequences, reducing the risk of clustering and ensuring better coverage. This is especially useful when the number of experiments is fixed, and you need a representative sampling of the parameter space.

This design is useful when the number of factors and levels is small, and when interactions between factors are expected to be important. It is especially useful when the goal is to understand how multiple factors interact with each other and influence the outcome of an experiment. This design provides comprehensive data, allowing for the analysis of both individual effects and interactions between factors.

The design is also confounded, meaning that some main effects are aliased with interactions. This design is particularly useful when the number of factors is large, and when interactions between factors are not expected to be important. By using fewer runs, fractional designs sacrifice some detailed information, particularly interactions between factors, but are effective in capturing the main effects. This trade-off is acceptable when interactions between factors are assumed to be less critical.

It was introduced by Bradley Jones and Christopher Nachtsheim in 2011 as a more efficient and versatile screening tool compared to traditional screening designs, such as fractional factorial or Plackett-Burman designs. The primary purpose of a DSD is to screen factors (independent variables) and identify the most significant ones that influence the response (dependent variable) in an experiment. DSDs are designed to handle experiments where there may be a large number of factors, but only a few are likely to be influential. DSDs are structured to avoid the confounding of main effects with two-factor interactions. This means that DSDs allow for the estimation of main effects independently, and the effects of interactions between factors are not confounded with them. Each factor in a DSD is typically tested at three levels: low (-1), middle (0), and high (+1). This allows for the detection of non-linear effects, which is a key advantage over traditional two-level screening designs. DSDs are highly efficient, requiring fewer experimental runs than traditional designs while still providing valuable information about the main effects and interactions. The number of experimental runs is often equal to $2k + 1$, where $k$ is the number of factors, making them much smaller in size for initial screening experiments. DSDs can detect both main effects and interactions, as well as quadratic effects (non-linear relationships between factors and responses). This is a significant improvement over many other screening designs, which focus only on main effects.",
