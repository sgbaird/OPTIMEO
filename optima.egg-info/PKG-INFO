# OPTIMA – Optimization Platform for Intelligent Experiment Management and Analysis <img src="ressources/logo.png" width="100"/>

## About this app

[OPTIMA](https://optima-bo.streamlit.app/) is a web application that helps you optimize your experimental process by generating a Design of Experiment (DoE), generating new experiments using Bayesian Optimization, and analyzing the results of your experiments using Machine Learning models.

This App was developed within the frame of an academic research project, MOFSONG, funded by the French National Research Agency (N° ANR-xxxxxx). See the related paper reference in [How to cite](#how-to-cite).

---

## Usage

### With the web app

You can use the app directly on its [Streamlit.io web page](https://optima-bo.streamlit.app/), or run it locally (see [Installation](#installation)).

Choose the page you want to use in the sidebar, and follow the instructions. Hover the mouse on the question marks to get more information about the parameters.

**1. Design of Experiment:**  
Generate a Design of Experiment (DoE) for the optimization of your process. Depending on the number of factors and levels, you can choose between different types of DoE, such as Sobol sequence, Full Factorial, Fractional Factorial, or Definitive Screening Design.

**2. New experiments using Bayesian Optimization:**  
From a previous set of experiments and their results, generate a new set of experiments to optimize your process. You can choose the sampler you want to use, depending on if you are on the early stages of the optimization and want to explore the phase space (then, choose the Sobol pseudo-random generator), or if you want to efficiently find the maximum of minimum in the response (then choose the Bayesian Optimization one).  

**3. Data analysis and modeling:**  
Analyze the results of your experiments and model the response of your process.

### With the Python package

You can also use the app as a Python package (see [Installation](#installation)). You can import the different modules of the app and use them in your own code. Here is an example of how to use the app as a package:

#### For Design of Experiment

A more detailed example is given in [the notebook](notebooks/doe.ipynb)

```python
from optima.doe import * 
parameters = [
    {'name': 'Temperature', 'type': 'integer', 'values': [20, 40]},
    {'name': 'Pressure', 'type': 'float', 'values': [1, 2, 3]},
    {'name': 'Catalyst', 'type': 'categorical', 'values': ['A', 'B', 'C']}
]
doe = DesignOfExperiments(
    type='Sobol sequence',
    parameters=parameters,
    Nexp=8
)
doe
```

#### For Bayesian Optimization

A more detailed example is given in [the notebook](notebooks/bo.ipynb)

```python
from optima.bo import * 

features, outcomes = read_experimental_data('experimental_data.csv', out_pos=[-1])
bo = BOExperiment(
    features=features, 
    outcomes=outcomes,
    N = 2, # number of new points to generate
    maximize=True, # we want to maximize the response
    outcome_constraints=None,
    fixed_features=None, 
    feature_constraints=None, 
    optim = 'bo'
)
bo.suggest_next_trials()
```

#### For Data Analysis

A more detailed example is given in [the notebook](notebooks/MLanalysis.ipynb)

```python
from optima.analysis import * 

data = pd.read_csv('dataML.csv')
factors = data.columns[:-1]
response = data.columns[-1]
analysis = DataAnalysis(data, factors, response)
analysis.model_type = "ElasticNetCV"
MLmodel = analysis.compute_ML_model()
figs = analysis.plot_ML_model()
for fig in figs:
    fig.show()
```

## Installation

You can use the app directly on its [Streamlit.io web page](https://optima-bo.streamlit.app/).

If you'd rather run this app on your local machine (which will most probably make it faster than running it on streamlit.io), you need to have Python installed. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then, you can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colinbousige/OPTIMA.git
cd OPTIMA
# either
pip install . # to install OPTIMA as a package
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt # to install the required packages
```

Finally, you can run the app by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

If you did `pip install .`, you can upgrade to new a version or uninstall with:

```bash
# upgrade the optima package
cd OPTIMA
pip install --upgrade .
# uninstall the optima package
pip uninstall optima
```
